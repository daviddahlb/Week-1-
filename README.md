### Muser

### App Description
Tinder, but for music for discovering and rating new music.

### App Idea Evaluation
**Mobile** Quick introduction to new artists by quickly cycling through their media (songs, pics) is perfect for a mobile platform that wants your 'spare time' moments. Today, mobile platforms is where everyone keeps and accesses their music, or connecting mobile to a speaker it all starts from mobile.
**Story** Connects musicians and fans, gives very detailed feedback and data to musicians about their potential fans such as regional likes/dislikes, what songs people swipe right on, what songs do ppl swipe left on. What regions need a live show.
**Market**  People that want to discover new music tailored to their likes/dislikes over time
**Habit** Being on the cusp of new music and undiscovered music is very exciting. Because of the quick access, the app avails itself for the spare short minutes like waiting or dead-time where one might listen to music anyways.
**Scope** Start focused on undiscovered music talent, up-and-comers, this strategy also takes advantage of the 'taste-maker' users who are on the forefront of adoption.  Expand to mainstream music and bigger artists who want to get feedback on experiments or new potential music.
