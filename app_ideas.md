### Facebook
**Category** Social

**Story** very compelling, need this access to social media and functionality all the time (messaging, news, etc)
**Market** worldwide
**Habit** extremely habit forming due to social feedback, and randomized feeds

### Google App (search, news all-in-one)
**Category** Search, news
**Mobile** The convenience of searching on one app and having an automatic news feed 
**Story** Give people the convenience of a go to app for news rather than opening up an app just for news from a particular source

**Scope** Access to information and websites was how the Goolge behemoth began, this continues to be one of there main sources of revenue

### Google Maps
**Category** Transportation (maps and Navigation)
**Mobile** instant gps location, functionality focused on the mobile experience compared to the website, limited screen size, ample use of hide-away menu panels
**Story** one-stop shop for what is around you is very compelling, hard to open up other navigation or 'near-me' apps such as yelp when the functionality and data-relevance delivery is well-done.
**Market** worldwide
**Habit** Not necessarily habit-forming in that one will just be opening this app when they have a spare minute, but it is an indispensible tool when needed.
**Scope** Delivers information worldwide but very narrowly focuses the information on the screen to nearby relevant places,

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
Tinder, but for music
-**Category** Entertainment, Social, Media & Video
**Mobile** Quick introduction to new artists by quickly cycling through their media (songs, pics) is perfect for a mobile platform that wants your 'spare time' moments. Today, mobile platforms is where everyone keeps and accesses their music, or connecting mobile to a speaker it all starts from mobile.
**Story** Connects musicians and fans, gives very detailed feedback and data to musicians about their potential fans such as regional likes/dislikes, what songs people swipe right on, what songs do ppl swipe left on. What regions need a live show.
**Market**  People that want to discover new music tailored to their likes/dislikes over time
**Habit** Being on the cusp of new music and undiscovered music is very exciting. Because of the quick access, the app avails itself for the spare short minutes like waiting or dead-time where one might listen to music anyways.
**Scope** Start focused on undiscovered music talent, up-and-comers, this strategy also takes advantage of the 'taste-maker' users who are on the forefront of adoption.  Expand to mainstream music and bigger artists who want to get feedback on experiments or new potential music.

Background timer
**Category** Productivity
**Mobile** We use our phones and tablets more for the apps that make us less productive
**Story** We need tangible numbers that tell us how unproductive we actually are, we would be able to see the improvements that we make in our allocation of time per day
**Market**  Anyone who feels they waste a lot of time on unnecessary apps like Facebook and YouTube
**Habit** It would just be something you install and runs in the background. You would be notified of the time spent on platforms you consider to be unproductive. Wouldn't necessarily be something you become addictive unless people become obsessed with the improvements they make
**Scope**  Runs in the background and would rely mostly on a timer, the other features would be more data analysis. Could be very simple depending on the complexity of the data analysis

Personal Dashboard
**Category** Productivity
**Mobile** Having a centralized depository of productivity data is critical that it be an app, and be able to follow the user.
**Story** Allows people to look at their tasks, assignments, goals, etc.
**Market** Anyone with internet access, people who want to be productive and track productivity.
**Habit** It's meant to help you being productive, but if people like productivity it can be addicting.
**Scope** A simple dashboard to show your goals/assignments. It can become more powerful with the use of ML to give you suggestions on what to do first and how to group your tasks to be more efficient.
